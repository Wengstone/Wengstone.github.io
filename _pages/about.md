I am a second year graduate student from [School of Mathematical and Sciences](https://math.bnu.edu.cn), [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn). My reasarch interest includes geometry, partial differential equation on the graph, machine learning and deep learning.

I am very fortunate to be recommended to Berkeley as a visiting student from January 2024. I am tutored by [Prof. LiangZhao](https://math.bnu.edu.cn). 

You can find my CV here:[Stone's Curriculum Vitae](http://archive.is/3TPas).
